# Game Content Generation Using Multiple PCGML (Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning) Methods

### About
Game content generation using multiple Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) methods refers to the utilization of various machine learning techniques to autonomously create diverse and engaging content for video games.This project has been set to explore new opportunities for generating high quality game contents especially functional contents such as game levels and game maps without human involvement. Multiple PCGML methods have been utilized including neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, autoencoders, deep convolutional networks, multi-dimensional markov chains, clustering and matrix factorization to get the optimum results. The concept involves using multiple machine learning methods or a combination of techniques to produce content that enhances gameplay, increases replayability, and enriches the overall gaming experience.
